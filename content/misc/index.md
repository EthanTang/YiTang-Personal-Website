      text: - I am originally from Leibo, [Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liangshan_Yi_Autonomous_Prefecture), Sichuan, China, where my parents still reside and work. It remains one of the least developed regions in the country predominantly inhabited by the [Yi ethnic minority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_people). Although, coincidentally, my first name is Yi (懿), I am not ethnically Yi (彝). My hometown has absolutely gorgeous scenaries as you can see from the photos below, but its people suffer from huge inequities in many aspects of their lives such as education, healthcare, living condition and so on. My experience growing up there largely shapes my research interest in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).
