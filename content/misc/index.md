        - I am originally from Leibo, [Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liangshan_Yi_Autonomous_Prefecture), Sichuan, China, where my parents still reside and work. It remains one of the least developed regions in the country and it's predominantly inhabited by the [Yi ethnic minority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_people). Although, coincidentally, my first name is Yi (懿), I am not ethnically Yi (彝). My hometown has absolutely gorgeous scenaries as you can see from the [photos](#gallery_leibo) below, but its people suffer from huge inequities in many aspects of their lives such as education, healthcare, living condition and so on. My experience growing up there largely shapes my research interest in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).

        - Outside my academic life, I am an enthusiastic classical clarinetist and recently started to learn band conducting. I was the captain (i.e., student leader) of the Tsinghua University Symphonic Band from 2013-2014. I played the clarinet in University of Minnesota University Band, Campus Orchestra, and Summer Orchestra for many years. I also played a clarinet duet with my roommate in his doctoral recital and conducted the UMN University Band in spring 2021.
